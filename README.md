# Cult-Idle-Game
a small project i'm working on, not sure if i'll be finishing this or even working on it, but we'll see

to-do short term (in order of importance):
- ore smelted will initially be parts of random metal ingots, later on you can
  transmute into specific ores with a tech unlock
  - code ore transmuting to random metals (eugh)

- code a storage-increasing building

- code allocation of cultists to auto-transmuting certain products

- once enough resources are acquired, new buildings  in the tech tree will require an additional component: blood, obtained by transmuting cultists
    - transmuting cultists will increasingly lengthen the amount of time taken
      for a cultist to come back

- code a tech tree that takes research points and time, then gives u permanent upgrades
  - upgrades along lines of (only examples):
    - "cultists transmute resources faster"
    - "chance of bad ore reduced from 50% to 30%"
    - "chance of ore increased to 50%" - 10rp
      - "chance of ore from stone removed, but new tab to allow direct ore gathering" - 50rp
        - "allowance to choose which ore" - 500rp (all examples subject to change)
  - how do you get research points?
    - very first rp comes from a certain event, which is used (along with some resources and blood) to allow for further rp to be gained
    - options: transmutation randomly has chance of giving rp
    - transmuting cultists -> blood gives research points
    - allocating cultists to research for points
    - continue to brainstorm on this, it's okay to change things as it goes, this will be a VERY important aspect of the game
    - (i can implement all or a mix or none listed here, who knows)

- code more buildings and transmutations



to-do long term:
- re-haul the html on transmutation - i'd like a branching tree with circular
  icons for each thing, so that way there's no navigating through tabs, just
  click on what you want
  - when a resource is clicked on, additional circles pop-up with diff. amounts
- implement a tech tree
